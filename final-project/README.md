# Speech Snap 🎙️🖼️
 Speech Snap is a web application that uses a speech-to-text function to input your spoken words into a search field and then leverages the DALL-E API to generate and return an image based on your search query. With Speech Snap, you can easily search for and generate images using just your voice.

 You can generate free images for your business or leisure with convenience!

## Description 💡
Speech Snap is a react application with a built in speech-to-text conversion for convenience and accessibility. 

🗣️ Voice input: Speak your heart out, and we'll convert it into text.

🧠 DALL-E API: The AI brain that brings your words to life as images.

🌈 User-friendly interface: Because we're fun. 


## Pre-Requisites 📝
 🌐 A web browser with support for the Web Speech API (e.g., Google Chrome)
 
 🔑 An API key for the DALL-E API (obtain one from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/))


## How to set up 🛠️
1. Clone our repository:
git clone https://github.com/Pete-Andrew/final-project

2. Install the dependencies: 
npm install

3. Create a secret .env file in the root directory and whisper your DALL-E API key:

    REACT_APP_API_KEY="stick your api key in here"

4. Start the development server:
npm start

## How to use 🎮
- Click the mic icon to let your voice do the work.
- Say your search query (e.g. "an old man with a bag of eels").
- Watch as Speech Snap processes your words and reveals a cool image generated by DALL-E.
- If you just want to use the deployed page and not bother with cloning the repository, use it in the webpage, grab an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), and stick it in the API key hole on the page!
